Lab 4 - Din Tai Fung Design Pattern

Im using two design patterns for this lab.

Chain of Responsibility : The Restaurant class will send the responsibility of assigning the table to the Restaurant Manager which processes it and in turn hands over the responsibility to Table Manager

Observer Pattern : The Table Manager class notifies its observersâ€™ Restaurant and Restaurant manager about the availability of the table.
