**Lab 4 - Din Tai Fung Design Pattern**
<br><br>
Im using two design patterns for this lab.

**Chain of Responsibility** : The Restaurant class will send the responsibility of assigning the table to the Restaurant Manager which processes it and in turn hands over the responsibility to Table Manager<br>
**Observer Pattern** : The Table Manager class notifies its observersâ€™ Restaurant and Restaurant manager about the availability of the table.
