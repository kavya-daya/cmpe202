### Lab 10 


Comparison of Lab 1 and Lab 10 solutions

The objective of lab 1 was to code a gumball machine that supported all configuration - ie, one quarter, two quarter and any coin.
Here , for each of the model a separate class had to be implemented. Thus in future if we needed to add another model of 
gumball machine. 

In lab 10 , we use Aspect J compiler with Feature IDE on eclipse to implement a gumball machine model that is similar to lab 1
Using Aspect, we use configuration files to implement different gumball machine models. Thus if a new model needs to be implemented
it can be done so by choosing different options in the default.config file.
Thus it becomes easier to both implement and debug different models using AspectJ
